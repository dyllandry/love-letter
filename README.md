Automatically send unique messages to someone special. ðŸ’˜

## Planning

 Don't need structure of a relational database, document-style is good enough.
 
 Estimates of [Amazon Document DB](https://aws.amazon.com/documentdb/pricing/) price:
 
 ```
 On-demand instance type: db.t3.medium
 Price/instance/hour consumed: $0.076
 Instance/hour minumum billed duration: 10 minutes
 Price/instance/hour @ 10 minute minimum billed duration: $0.076 / 6 = $0.013
 10 minute billed instances/day = 3 (based on sending 3 messages a day)
 Total monthly price = 3 * $0.013 * 30/days = $1.17/month
 ```
